    I've noticed you might be going through a tough time, and I want you to know I'm here for you. Your feelings are valid, and it's okay to ask for help. If you're comfortable, I'm here to listen. Remember, seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness. Reach out to someone you trust or consider talking to a professional. You're not alone, and I care about you.

    Take care,''')
