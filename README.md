# VisionEase Wear
Technology for a better future
## What is this
VisionEase Wear is the concept of pair of glasses that detects obstacles around and assists visually impaired people with audio feedback. This will ease their life and will not only be informed about obstacles but also help them quickly recognize documents and qr codes by directly reading the text or the content of the qr code, for example, a qr menu. People who has access to this device wont need to learn complicated reading and writing systems like Braille. 
## How we will do it
We will take regular pair of glasses for people with low vision or sunglasses for people with no vision at all and attach a small camera and integrate it to the arduino UNO R3 microcontrollers or raspberry pi that would be the processor of our device. Both of these chips can easily be connected to earphones with 3.55 mm AUX of USB. Image recognition wont be that hard as I am already experienced with both text-to-speech and image recognition software in Python(https://teymuur.github.io/mood-detector-py-by-ty.zip). The whole setup will be affordable and if project expands, people from all background will be able to use it as it would be cheaper than most of assistive technology.
## About Us
Even tho it would take a lot of effort to build a prototype of VisionEase Wear, we believe that it could be the winner of SABIS® STARS and help thousands of people  have a better future and easier lives. We are planning to make the code of this device open source so a lot of people can just download it and can make their own glasses by connecting a camera to a microcontroller.
